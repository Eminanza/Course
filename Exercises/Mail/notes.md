# Landing Page

Now it's the other way around: our copy writer created an HTML page, but he did not add any style, so the result is a bit bland.

Using what you know in CSS, try to improve the look of the page the best you can, without changing any of the HTML - work only in the CSS file.

The objective here is to create what we call a _Landing Page_: a teaser to get people interested in our product/service.

## Done?

Try to add more content, and customize it for a company you know.
